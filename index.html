            While recent years have seen rapid progress in image-conditioned text generation, image captioning still suffers from the fundamental issue of hallucinations, the generation of spurious details that cannot be inferred from the given image.
            Dedicated methods for reducing hallucinations in image captioning largely focus on closed-vocabulary object tokens, ignoring most types of hallucinations that occur in practice.<br>
            In this work, we propose MOCHa, an approach that harnesses advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) to address the sequence-level nature of hallucinations in an open-vocabulary setup.
            To optimize for caption fidelity to the input image, we leverage ground-truth reference captions as proxies to measure the logical consistency of generated captions.
            However, optimizing for caption fidelity alone fails to preserve the semantic adequacy of generations; therefore, we propose a multi-objective reward function that jointly targets these qualities, without requiring any strong supervision.
            We demonstrate that these goals can be simultaneously optimized with our framework, enhancing performance for various captioning models of different scales.
            Our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate MOCHa's superior performance across various established metrics.<br>
            We also demonstrate the benefit of our method in the open-vocabulary setting. To this end, we contribute OpenCHAIR, a new benchmark for quantifying open-vocabulary hallucinations in image captioning models, constructed using generative foundation models.

            We build the multi-objective reward model as follows. In order to measure fidelity to the input image, we feed a GT reference caption and a generated caption to a pre-trained Natural Language Inference (NLI) model, which predicts the probability of contradiction between the two texts.
            To measure adequacy we use BERTScore, a pretrained model measuring the general quality of the generated text relative to the GT reference.
            Following prior work, we add a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to the reward model which constrains the model to stay close to its initial state. This prevents the model from 'forgetting' valuable knowledge that it acquired during pre-training (like caption fluency and diversity) and restrains it from converging to adversarial solutions which 'reward-hack' the objective.
            Our total reward function takes the form \(r = \alpha \cdot r_{f} + (1-\alpha) \cdot r_{a} + \beta \cdot r_{kl}\) , where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are positive scalars controlling the tradeoff between our multiple objectives.

          Our approach is different from conventional sketching methods in that it does not utilize a sketch dataset for training, rather it is optimized under the guidance of CLIP. Thus, our method is not limited to specific categories observed during training, as no category definition was introduced at any stage. This makes our method robust to various inputs.

            OpenCHAIR is a benchmark for evaluating open-vocabulary hallucinations in image captioning models.
            OpenCHAIR's open-vocabulary design lets it measure a significantly large amount of object types, especially when compared to the existing metric CHAIR.
            The core idea of OpenCHAIR is to compare the objects in the predicted and reference captions with a LLM instead of relying on closed object and synonym lists that heavily limit scaling.
            Additionally, our open-vocabulary approach enables finer-grained distinctions between objects, as demonstrated in the example below:

            <!-- The above illustrates the fundamentally different nature of quantifying open-vocabulary hallucinations with OpenCHAIR, compared to the closed-vocabulary evaluation of CHAIR. -->
            Given the above image and groundtruth information, OpenCHAIR extracts concrete objects from a
            predicted caption and identifies hallucinated objects from this list by querying an LLM.
            In contrast, in the above case the predicted object guitar would not be counted by CHAIR since it is not in its
            fixed vocabulary, while man would not be counted as a hallucination since it is given as a synonym of child in CHAIR's vocabulary.
